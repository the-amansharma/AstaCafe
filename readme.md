## Responsive Images Implementation

The website uses modern responsive image techniques to optimize performance:

- **srcset and sizes attributes**: Provides multiple image sizes for browsers to choose from based on viewport and device pixel ratio
- **Picture element**: Used for art direction to serve different image crops based on screen size
- **Lazy loading**: Images load only when they enter the viewport
- **Blur-up effect**: Low-quality image placeholders that transition to full-quality images
- **Optimized image formats**: Multiple sizes of each image to reduce bandwidth usage
